I am a second year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Colorado Boulder](http://colorado.edu). My research area is Human-Centered Computing. I am part of Project EPIC (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor Leysia Palen. My research interests are in crisis informatics, social computing, information diffusion, and data visualization.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Santa Clara University](http://scu.edu). My interest in human-centered computing comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development.
