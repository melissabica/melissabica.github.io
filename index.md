I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [University of Colorado Boulder](http://colorado.edu). My research area is Human-Centered Computing. I am part of [Project EPIC](http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/) (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor Leysia Palen. My research interests are in crisis informatics, social computing, information diffusion, and data visualization.

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Santa Clara University](http://scu.edu). My interest in human-centered computing comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development.
