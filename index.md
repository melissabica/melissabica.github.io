I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at [University of Colorado Boulder](http://colorado.edu). I am part of [Project EPIC](http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/) (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor [Leysia Palen](http://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/). My research focuses on how people interpret and interact around online hurricane forecast images to understand their risk. 

Research areas: human-centered computing, crisis informatics, social computing, computer-supported cooperative work

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from [Santa Clara University](http://scu.edu). My interest in human-centered computing comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development.
