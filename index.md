I'm currently a User Experience Researcher at Yahoo. Earlier in 2020, I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the <a target="_blank" href="http://colorado.edu">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, where I was part of <a target="_blank" href="http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project EPIC</a> (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/">Leysia Palen</a>, and a graduate student research affiliate with the <a target="_blank" href="
https://hazards.colorado.edu/">Natural Hazards Center</a>. My dissertation research focused on the diffusion of forecast and other risk visuals on social media during hurricanes and how people make sense of representations of risk and uncertainty.

In the summer of 2018, I completed an internship with the User Experience Research team at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.verizonmedia.com/">Yahoo</a> in Sunnyvale, CA, where I now work full-time.

Previously, I received a M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Colorado Boulder and a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="http://scu.edu">Santa Clara University</a>. My interest in human-centered computing comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development.  

**Research areas:** human-computer interaction (HCI), crisis informatics, computer supported cooperative work (CSCW), social computing, information science, user experience
