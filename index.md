I am a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at <a target="_blank" href="http://colorado.edu">University of Colorado Boulder</a>, where I also received a M.S. in Computer Science. I am part of <a target="_blank" href="http://epic.cs.colorado.edu/">Project EPIC</a> (Empowering the Public with Information in Crisis) working with Professor <a target="_blank" href="http://cmci.colorado.edu/~palen/">Leysia Palen</a>, and I am a graduate student research affiliate with the <a target="_blank" href="
https://hazards.colorado.edu/">Natural Hazards Center</a>. My research focuses on the diffusion of forecast and other risk visuals on social media during hurricanes and how people make sense of representations of risk and uncertainty.

I recently completed an internship with the User Experience Research team for Yahoo Mail at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.oath.com/">Oath</a> in Sunnyvale, CA.

Research areas: human-centered computing, crisis informatics, social computing, computer-supported cooperative work

Previously, I graduated with a B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering from <a target="_blank" href="http://scu.edu">Santa Clara University</a>. My interest in human-centered computing comes from several of my experiences throughout college, including training rural women in IT skills in India, developing a mobile app for local homeless people in the Bay Area, and leading a group of high school girls as they learned programming and mobile development.
